# PKG_CONFIG...
# 	This enables E2fsprogs to be built without requiring Pkg-config to be built and installed first.
# --with-root-prefix=""
# 	Certain programs (such as the e2fsck program) are considered essential programs. When, for example, /usr is not mounted, these programs still need to be available. They belong in directories like /lib and /sbin. If this option is not passed to E2fsprogs' configure, the programs are installed into the /usr directory.
# --enable-elf-shlibs
# 	This creates the shared libraries which some programs in this package use.
# --disable-*
# 	This prevents E2fsprogs from building and installing the libuuid and libblkid libraries, the uuidd daemon, and the fsck wrapper, as Util-Linux installed all of them earlier.
