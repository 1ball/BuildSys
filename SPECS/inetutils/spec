CONFIGFLAGS='--libexecdir=/usr/sbin --localstatedir=/var --disable-ifconfig --disable-logger --disable-syslogd --disable-whois --disable-servers'
# --disable-ifconfig
#    This option prevents Inetutils from installing the ifconfig program, which can be used to configure network interfaces. BuildSys uses ip from IPRoute2 to perform this task.
# --disable-logger
#    This option prevents Inetutils from installing the logger program, which is used by scripts to pass messages to the System Log Daemon. Do not install it because Util-linux installed a version earlier.
# --disable-syslogd
#    This option prevents Inetutils from installing the System Log Daemon, which is installed with the Sysklogd package.
# --disable-whois
#    This option disables the building of the Inetutils whois client, which is out of date. Instructions for a better whois client are in the BLFS book.
# --disable-servers
#    This disables the installation of the various network servers included as part of the Inetutils package. These servers are deemed not appropriate in a basic system. Some are insecure by nature and are only considered safe on trusted networks. More information can be found at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/basicnet/inetutils.html. Note that better replacements are available for many of these servers.
